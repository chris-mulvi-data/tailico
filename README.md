# Tailico

Tailico == Tail In Color.

I wanted a way to add color output when tailing log files so I wrote this over
a weekend.  This was mostly an experiment and a way of learning a bit more
about Go.

The colorization is currently written around the output from Wilfly server logs
since that's what I needed to look at when I got this idea.
